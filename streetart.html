            <p>Amsterdam has always been a city of art.
                But for the birth of street art, we will have
                to travel back in time to the 20th century.
                Amsterdam was a massive city for its time,
                with the industrial revolution going at full
                speed. This great technological and eco
                nomic advance did, however, leave plenty of
                poor neighbourhoods throughout Amsterdam.
                 And in those neighbourhoods, we see
                the first signs of street art, with texts being
                written on the walls and squatters leaving
                graffiti on houses and cars.
                For street art, as we know it today, we will
                have to flash forward to the latter half of the
                20th century. Just like it was in the first half
                of the century we see a rise in street art in the
                poorer neighbourhoods of the city: areas like
                the Pijp, the Jordaan, Osdorp and the Bijlmer.
                And especially in those neighbourhoods a new
                era of street art was ushered in, influenced by
                American pop culture.
                Graffiti groups like Osdorp Posse grew into
                hip-hop icons and stores like Henxs Montana
                Shop gained a cult following. The art became
                more as we know it today, with big letters and
                vibrant colours, as the artists started to take
                more and more creative liberties.</p>

            <p>Amsterdam is known as a city of
                art and artists, but to enjoy Amsterdam's art,
                one can also stray away
                from the usual museums at the
                Museumplein. The beauty of street
                art is that it can be made on the
                streets and with that possibility,
                any street in particular.
                Underneath the A10 motorway, on the
                back of street signs and on the side
                of buildings and factories. You can
                also do a free street art tour through
                Amsterdam. Use the Interactive map
                from <a href="https://www.streetartcities.com">here</a> and 
                discover many secret places without any
                effort. Amsterdam is a city to explore.
                So get out there and see for yourself!</p>
